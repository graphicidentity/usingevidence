                                I have had a strong focus on evaluation methods for many years because I think we need new approaches that take account of complexity and that also look at systems not only at projects and programs. I worked with colleagues on the development of <a href="https://www.idrc.ca/en/book/outcome-mapping-building-learning-and-reflection-development-programs">Outcome Mapping</a> as well as an approach to <a href="/usingevidence/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Organizational_Assessment_A_Framework_for_Improving_Performance_by_Fred_Beck_Carden_at_Using_Evidence_Inc.pdf">Organizational Assessment</a>. Both of these methods integrate context directly into the assessment approach and treat it as a key variable.

                                Major evaluations can benefit from an external perspective to review the design and draft report. I have carried out quality assessments for <a href="http://www.universalia.com/en">Universalia Management Group</a> on evaluations they have conducted for the World Food Program, and for <a href="https://www.iucn.org/">IUCN</a> on Value for Money assessments.

                                Evidence from research and evaluation needs to be used if it is going to contribute to social improvement. Too often we focus on the methods and the study itself and forget about use until the very end. Use needs to be thought about from the beginning. This focus was reinforced by a study I did for the International Development Research Centre in which we looked at how the research the Centre supports influences public policy – <a href="/usingevidence/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Knowledge_to_Policy__Making_the_Most_of_Development_Research_by_Fred_Beck_Carden_at_Using_Evidence_Inc.pdf">Knowledge to Policy</a>.

                                Many organizations struggle to develop effective and use-oriented evaluation systems that help the organization learn and improve. While at the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) I was involved in the design of evaluation systems and processes that helped the organization and its programs learn from experience. Since leaving IDRC, I have worked with the <a href="http://www.mastercardfdn.org/">MasterCard Foundation</a> providing support on their evaluation system and I worked with a team to support the development of an evaluation and learning system at the <a href="https://www.rhf-frh.ca/">Rideau Hall Foundation</a> in Canada.

                                I am actively involved in evaluations as well. While at IDRC I was involved in a wide range of evaluations. More recently I have been involved in <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2017/1/corporate-evaluation-of-the-regional-architecture-of-un-women">organizational assessment of UNWomen (regional architecture)</a> in collaboration with EnCompass, and at the Rideau Hall Foundation, with Cindy Weeks Consulting. With Global Affairs Canada, I integrated a Principles-Focused approach to a <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/gac-amc/publications/evaluation/2018/colombia-summary_colombie-summaire.aspx?lang=eng">country program evaluation</a> which GAC has reused in other country program evaluations.

                                Evaluation should leave behind improved capacity to do evaluation.
